We are dedicated to serving international students attending schools in this region. We firmly believe that success comes from professional and comprehensive service. Currently, our center has established long-term strategic partnerships with a number of renowned educational institutions in the United States and well-known study abroad agencies in China. Based on a thorough review of our past services, we are committed to creating a more efficient, effective, and comprehensive one-stop service for studying in the U.S. We provide a range of services to support students' transitions, including housing assistance, student supervision and management, academic advising, tutoring, and more. However, we are not an agency and do not provide agency services. Our 24/7 services assist students in case of emergencies, ensuring a smooth transition to school and dorm life.",
